a) [**Using Artificial Intelligence to stop Forest Fires through flame and smoke detection**](https://omdena.com/blog/stop-wildfires/)
	
Developed and optimized an AI technology collaboratively with a team of 38 AI Engineers, that accurately detects real fire outbreaks (smoke and flames) in forests and plantations, reducing the fire detection time more than 95% of the time from an average of 5 minutes to 1.5 minutes, with a recall evaluation metric of 96%.

A team of [**28 AI Experts and Data Scientists**](https://omdena.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-covid19/) collaborated to gauge the impact of policies on vulnerable populations implemented during pandemics like COVID-19. The goal was to find correlations and encourage data-driven policymaking to lessen the adversity for most vulnerable populations.
